## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Each contributor is required to [sign a CLA](https://cla.shopify.com/). This process is automated as part of your first pull request and is only required once. If any contributor has not signed or does not have an associated GitHub account, the CLA check will fail and the pull request is unable to be merged.

## Bugs

### Where to find known issues

We track all of our issues and bugs in GitHub. If you are planning to work on an issue, avoid ones which already have an assignee.

### Reporting new issues

To reduce duplicates, look through open issues before filing one. The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case with a story example.

## Feature requests

Before requesting a feature, search our issues. If it doesn't already exist, open an issue to start a discussion.

## Proposing a change

If you intend to build a new component, change a public API, make design improvements, or any other non-trivial changes, we recommend filing an issue so we can reach an agreement on the proposal before you put in time and effort.

If you‚Äôre fixing a bug, it‚Äôs okay to submit a pull request right away. We still recommend you file an issue detailing what you‚Äôre fixing in case we don‚Äôt accept that specific fix, but want to keep track of the issue.
