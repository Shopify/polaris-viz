## [0.23.1] - 2021-10-27

### Changed

- Upgrade React to version 17. Updates the `peerDependencies` to allow React 16 or 17. No consumer-facing changes are expected.

### Added

- Added animations to `<NormalizedStackedBarChart />`.

## [0.23.0] - 2021-10-27

### Added

- Added `<HorizontalBarChart />`.
- Added `grid.showHorizontalLines` theme option to `<StackedAreaChart />`.

## [0.22.0] - 2021-10-22

### Changed

- Switch the build system to use `loom` instead of a mix of `sewing-kit`, `rollup`, `typescript`, and other custom-built functionality. We now provide builds with CommonJS, ESM, and ESNext output.
- **Breaking change** The build output has moved. See `build/{cjs,esm,esnext}` for the various formats. Types have also moved to `build/ts/src`. See https://github.com/Shopify/web/pull/50652 for an example of how these changes might impact your project.
- **Breaking change** CSS class names are no longer prefixed and namedspaced in the same way. If you are targeting Polaris Viz elements, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-viz/issues/new) so we can talk about your scenario.
  - Before: `.PolarisViz-ChartContainer`, `.PolarisViz-Chart__BarGroup`, etc
  - After: `._ChartContainer_tub85_3`, `._BarGroup_ysryh_7`, etc
- **Potentially breaking change** We now generate a proper ESNext build that should _not_ require any workarounds when integrating with Webpack and `sewing-kit` (provided [`sewing-kit >= 0.135.0`](https://github.com/Shopify/sewing-kit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#01350---2020-08-19)).
- **Potentially breaking change** We now target [`@shopify/browserslist-config`](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/tree/main/packages/browserslist-config) for browser support. See the full list of changes [here](https://www.diffchecker.com/GYbqZwse). Most notably , we've dropped explicit support for the following browsers:
  - Safari < 13.1
  - iOS Safari < 12.2
  - Internet Explorer 11

#### Developer Changes

- We no longer support "absolute" import paths in our tests. This allowed us to import components via `import {Thing} from 'components/Thing'`, but now you must use the relative path (e.g. `import {Thing} from '../../components/Thing'`). This allow our build tools to be consistent and not needing to add support in different ways (e.g. `jest`, `rollup`, `storybook`).

## [0.21.5] - 2021-10-21

### Added

- Horizontal overflow style to `<StackedAreaChart />`

## [0.21.4] - 2021-10-20

### Added

- Fixed measurement logic around labels for small charts.
- Removed stray semi-colons in BarChart component

### Changed

## [0.20.2] - 2021-09-13

### Fixed

- Fixed the direction of the gradient on the horizontal `<NormalizedStackedBarChart />`

### Changed

## [0.20.0] - 2021-09-10

- Removed `tslib` as a dependency entirely. This change inlines the helpers used by TypeScript. The result is that the bundle is a little smaller (e.g. ~2KB after minification and gzip), and dependency issues become a non-problem.

### Changed

- Fixed wrong color being applied when `lineType` was not provided.

## [0.19.0-0] - 2021-08-31

### Added

- `PolarisVizProvider` to support theming charts
- The `theme` to prop to `<BarChart />`, `<LineChart />`, `<Sparkline />`, `<StackedAreaChart />` and `<Sparkbar />`

- `<Sparkline />`, `<StackedAreaChart />` and `<Sparkbar />` support gradient fills
- `<Legend />` text is now configurable via the theme

### Removed

- Polaris Tokens strings are no longer accepted as colors. Any valid CSS color can now be provided as a color to charts, and in some cases gradients can be specified by supplying an array of gradient stops.
- `barOptions`, `gridOptions`, `xAxisOptions.showTicks`, `xAxisOptions.labelColor` and `yAxisOptions.labelColor` from `BarChartProps` and `LineChartProps`.
- `barFillStyle` and `color` props are removed from the `<Sparkbar />` component and are inherited from the chart's theme
- `opacity` prop from `<StackedAreaChart />`. Opaque colors can now be directly specified in the series color prop or theme.
- `colors` prop from  `<NormalizedStackedBarChart />`

### Changed

- `<BarChart />`, `<LineChart />`, `<Sparkline />`, `<NormalizedStackedBarChart />`, `<MultiSeriesBarChart />` and `<Sparkbar />` styles now are defined through themes in `PolarisVizProvider` instead of props. For more details check the [migration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VxfcgBbTNwjmYix1jGuDMgqDgIdehTgQbVZpER7djeU/edit?usp=sharing)
- change indicators on the  `<NormalizedStackedBarChart />` can now have their colors configured externally, which applies the color to the metric and percentage change
- `SparkChartData` now accepts `value` and `color` properties, instead of `number | null`, to allow individual bars to override the `seriesColors`.

### Fixed

- in `<Sparkbar />`, align comparison bar and bars.
- `<NormalizedStackedBarChart />` no longer overflows its container by a few pixels
- [Updates `serialize-javascript` package](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-viz/pull/477). No consumer-facing changes are expected.

## [0.18.2] - 2021-08-17

- [Updates dev dependencies](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-viz/pull/474). No consumer-facing changes are expected.

## [0.18.1] - 2021-08-11

### Fixed

## [0.17.2] - 2021-06-23

### Changed

- Explicitly specifies `tslib@^2.1.0` instead of `tslib@^2.1` in an attempt to fix duplicated packages in `web`

## [0.17.1] - 2021-06-17

### Changed

- Adds `tslib@^2.1` to our package `dependencies` to avoid different versions of `tslib` resolving and breaking our code.

## [0.17.0] - 2021-06-16

POTENTIALLY BROKEN -- This release implicitly depends on `tslib>=2.1.0` but other projects may not explicitly be using `tslib>=2.1.0`. For example, this version sporadically breaks in `web` since the version of `tslib` in `web` resolves to `^1`.

It is not advised to use this version -- stick to `0.16.1` or wait for `0.17.1` which will fix this issue.

### Changed

- Upgrades our build tools to the latest major versions. We **do not** expect any change in behavior for consumers of Polaris Viz.

## [0.16.1] - 2021-06-09

### Fixed

## [0.12.3] - 2021-05-12
