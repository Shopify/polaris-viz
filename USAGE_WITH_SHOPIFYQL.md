# Usage with ShopifyQL

Polaris Viz components were built to easily integrate with [ShopifyQL](https://shopify.dev/api/shopifyql).

In [ShopifyQL Notebooks](https://www.shopify.ca/enterprise/shopifyql-notebooks), you can use the `VISUALIZE` keyword to display the fetched data as a specific visualization type, for example `line` or `bar`.

![Demonstration of how you can choose the visualization type to change fom BarChart to LineChart in ShopifyQL Notebooks](../../public/shopifyql_notebooks.gif)

If developing your own applications, you can use the `VISUALIZE` keyword to retrieve all information necessary to render Polaris Viz charts.
