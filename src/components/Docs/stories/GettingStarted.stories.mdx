<Title type="h2">Peer dependencies</Title>

Polaris Viz has peer dependencies on:

- `react@^16.8.6`
- `react-dom@^16.8.6`
- `@juggle/resize-observer@^3.3.1`

You are responsible for providing these packages in your project. By requiring these packages as `peerDependencies` we can be sure there won't be duplicate packages included due to version mismatches.

```
